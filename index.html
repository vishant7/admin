 <body><center><font size="10" color="#ff0066"> I am grateful to have such a precious lady in my life. Every second of my life, I crave for you my baby. 
   <br><br><br>I wish I could write what's in my heart on this webpage but frankly speaking words are not enough to express my gratitude of having someone like you in my life.
   I never had such a close friend. I never had such a good advisor. I never had such a wonderful being. 
   Your imperfection makes you perfect for me. (okay that one is a lie) </center></font>
 <br><br><center><font size="10" color="#00cc00"> Inshallah I will keep on wishing you happy birthday every single year. I pray that Allah keep us together in this life as well as the hereafter. Love you so much dou and once again happy birthday.
